                <p>Aside from these positive impacts on our brains, 
                    cannabis can also help heal our bodies. 
                    Evidence suggests that medical marijuana 
                    can help treat chronic pain, insomnia, depression, 
                    anxiety, nausea, appetite loss, and other symptoms and disorders. 
                    Cannabis use is now more popular than ever as more and more places 
                    choose to legalize marijuana.</p>
